This is my personal webdev portfolio. Built using ReactJS, html, css, & TailwindCSS.

My first dig into building a completely custom website where I said 'how do I want this to work?' and just figuring it out. 

GoogleMapsAPI, EmailJS, mapping through data to build components, and many other useful libraries to make this little guy come to life.






TO_DO:

Making the mobile About section look better.

Add buttons to projects to take you to the hosted website or the github.

Projects hover slides down.
