This is my personal webdev portfolio. Built using ReactJS, html, css, & TailwindCSS.

My first dig into building a completely custom website where I said 'how do I want this to work?' and just figuring it out. 

GoogleMapsAPI, EmailJS, mapping through data to build components, and many other useful libraries to make this little guy come to life.






TO_DO:

hamburder menu for mobile.

Add hidden class to About bg image for mobile.

add a GoogleMaps component to cimplify the Contact component.
